1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
The two Boolean type of Values are 
True
False
We write them in this format
True OR IN BINARY 1
False OR IN BINARY 0Three types of Boolean Data types
And 
Or
Not
P Q   AND OR NAND
T T   T   T   F
T F   F   T   T
F T   F   T   T
F F   F   F   TFALSE
FALSE
TRUE
FALSE 
FALSE
TRUE
THE SIX COMPARISION OPERATOR ARE
>= "GREATER THAN EQUAL TO"
<= "SMALLER THAN EQUAL TO"
== "EQUAL TO"
!= "NOT EQUAL TO"
> "GREATER THAN"
< "SMALLER THAN"ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR AND EQUAL TO OPERATOR ARE TWO DEFFERNT OPERATOR
WHERE IN NAME SAY ASSIGN SO WE YOU WANT TO ASSIGN THE VALUE THEN YOU CAN USE ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
FOR EX:-
VAR=8
HERE I AM USING THE "=" ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR TO  STORE THE VALUE IN VAR
WHERE AS IN EQUAL TO ("==") WILL COMPARE TWO VALUES OR TWO VAR IN WHICH THE VALUES IS STORED 
AND NOW THEN IT WILL RETURN ME THE VALUE OF BOOLEAN TYPE WHICH IS TRUE OR FALSE
KEEPING THIS IN MIND THAT TO WHERE I AM COMPARING THE VALUES SHOULD,BE IN THE SAME DATA TYPE
FOR EX:-
A=1
B=2
A==B
IT WILL RETURN ME FALSE AS IT MEAN THAT B EQUAL TO AIF SPAM==10:
IF SPAM>5:
ELSE:

```python
spam=int(input("Enter the values"))
if(spam==1):
    print("Hello")
elif(spam==2):
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings")
    
```
CTRL+CBREAK DEFINE AS IF YOU USE BREAK ANYWHERE IT WILL DIRECTLY COME OUT FROM CONDITION ONCE IT CALLS
FOR EX:
a="hello"
for i in range(len(a)):
    if(a[i]=='l'):
        print(i)
        break
        now in this you will find once it fill find a[i]=='l' it will terminate itself get out of loop
        where in continous it just skip the next step and continue from starting of loop    for i in range(10):
    print(i)
it will print from 0 to 10 excluding 10 by default it will take lower bond 0 and upper bond 10 but
it exclude 10 and every time it take 1 hop and it is also by default

for i in range(0,10):
    print(i)
in this you are giving it lower bond as zero and upper bond as one

now in 
for i in range(0,10,1)
here you declaring 0 as lower bond 10 as upper bond and hop as 1for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
    
i=1
while(i!=11):
    print(i)
    i+=1
    
    Here i use '11' as question says print all no.from 1 to 10 
    import spam.bacon()

```python

```
